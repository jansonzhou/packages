Description: Python command-line parsing library
 The argparse module makes it easy to write user friendly command line
 interfaces.
 .
 The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure out
 how to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automatically
 generates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the
 program invalid arguments.
 .
 As of Python >= 2.7 and >= 3.2, the argparse module is maintained within the
 Python standard library. For users who still need to support Python < 2.7 or
 < 3.2, it is also provided as a separate package, which tries to stay
 compatible with the module in the standard library, but also supports older
 Python versions.
