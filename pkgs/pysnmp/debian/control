Description: Python SNMP library for agents and managers (unstable branch)
 This is a Python implementation  of SNMP v.1/v.2c engine. Its general
 functionality  is  to  assemble/disassemble SNMP  messages  from/into
 given  SNMP Object  IDs  along with  associated  values. PySNMP  also
 provides a few transport methods specific to TCP/IP networking.
 .
 PySNMP is written entirely in  Python and is self-sufficient in terms
 that it does not rely on any third party tool (it isn't a wrapper).
 .
 PySNMP 4.x is the unstable branch.
