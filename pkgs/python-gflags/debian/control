Description: Commandline flags module for Python
 This project is the python equivalent of google-gflags, a Google commandline
 flag implementation for C++. It is intended to be used in situations where a
 project wants to mimic the command-line flag handling of a C++ app that uses
 google-gflags, or for a Python app that, via swig or some other means, is
 linked with a C++ app that uses google-gflags.
 The gflags package contains a library that implements commandline flags
 processing. As such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has increased
 flexibility, including built-in support for Python types, and the ability to
 define flags in the source file in which they're used. (This last is its major
 difference from OptParse.)
